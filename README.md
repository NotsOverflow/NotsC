NotsC
=====

The NotsC pronouced "not C" programing language


it's only the syntax for now, i'm still building the compiler.

the features will be :
 
 - avoiding common glitch by conception ( stack overflows , heap spraying , rop gadgets, call of functions that are not in the program manifest and so on ... )
 - none typed
 - automatic garbage collector
 - scope based variables and objects
 - build-in json arrays
 - build-in comon librarys and function ( internet socket, multimedia processing, signal, protocols ... and so on )
 - really readable ( human like syntax )
 - able to include dll/so and anssi C code to be use inside the code like ctypes in python.
